        <h1>Project 1: Seismic Analysis and Design Using NBC 105:2020</h1>

        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Junior Structural Designer</p>
        <p><strong>Company:</strong> National Design Engineering Consultancy</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May-2023 â€“ Aug-2024</p>

        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>In this project, I worked in around 10-12 different residential building site in Kathmandu and Nagarjun sites as site Engineer and Designer . The focus was on ensuring the building's ability to withstand seismic forces based on current Building code and also helped in cost minimization.</p>

        <h3>Responsibilities and Contributions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Conducted structural analysis using Etabs.</li>
            <li>Assisted in preparing structural drawings and models for the project.</li>
            <li>Performed calculations for load-bearing capacity and material strength.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with senior engineers on design optimization and safety compliance.</li>
            <li>Helped ensure the structural integrity of the design by analyzing seismic loads.</li>
        </ul>

       
        <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Contributed to the successful completion of design deliverables.</li>
            <li>Assisted in resolving design challenges related to seismic load analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Skills Gained:</h3>
        <u1>
            <li>Gained experience in structural design software (e.g., ETABS, SAFE).</li>
            <li>Developed a deeper understanding of material properties and load analysis.</li>
            <li>Enhanced teamwork and communication skills by working closely with senior engineers and clients.</li>
