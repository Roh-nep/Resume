<section class="project-details">
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Junior Structural Designer</p>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> National Design Engineering Consultancy</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May-2023 – Aug-2024</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I worked on 10-12 different residential building sites in Kathmandu and Nagarjun sites as a site engineer and designer. The focus was on ensuring the building's ability to withstand seismic forces based on the current building code and also helped in cost minimization.</p>

    <h2>Responsibilities and Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted structural analysis using ETABS.</li>
        <li>Assisted in preparing structural drawings and models for the project.</li>
        <li>Performed calculations for load-bearing capacity and material strength.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with senior engineers on design optimization and safety compliance.</li>
        <li>Helped ensure the structural integrity of the design by analyzing seismic loads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Contributed to the successful completion of design deliverables.</li>
        <li>Assisted in resolving design challenges related to seismic load analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gained experience in structural design software (e.g., ETABS, SAFE).</li>
        <li>Developed a deeper understanding of material properties and load analysis.</li>
        <li>Enhanced teamwork and communication skills by working closely with senior engineers and clients.</li>
    </ul>
