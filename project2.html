      <p>
        As a business enthusiast, I took on the challenge of creating <strong>Happy Shirts</strong>, a T-shirt design business that focuses on creativity and personal expression. This entrepreneurial project allowed me to blend my passion for design and business management, but also provided insights into the challenges of growing a startup.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Along with Happy Shirts, I also embarked on a project called <strong>Yourshell Hostel</strong>, an online platform that helps students easily book hostels. The idea for this project emerged from my own experience in hostels, where I observed a lack of streamlined booking systems and quality service. Through this platform, I aimed to offer students more than just a place to stay, but also amenities like gyms and better food options.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        During my journey with these projects, I was honored to receive the <strong>Hult Prize Semifinalist</strong> award for my innovative approach to solving problems related to student accommodation. The recognition motivated me to continue my entrepreneurial journey and explore opportunities for growth in the business and hospitality industries.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        These projects not only enhanced my skills in leadership, problem-solving, and team management, but they also ignited my passion for making a positive impact through entrepreneurship.
