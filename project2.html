    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>As part of our university project, I conducted the seismic analysis and structural design of a multi-storeyed commercial building using the <strong>Nepal Building Code  (NBC) 105_2020</strong>. The goal was to assess the structural safety of the building under seismic conditions and design the key structural components according to the latest seismic codes.</p>

    <h2>Responsibilities and Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Worked alongside groups, each focusing on different aspects of the design and analysis process. I took the lead on the seismic analysis, coordinating with the team to ensure that each design component adhered to the code requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Seismic Analysis:</strong> Using the NBC 105_2020, we evaluated the building's seismic performance, including load distribution and the response of structural elements to seismic forces. We conducted dynamic analysis using software like SAFE Pro and ETABS.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Design:</strong> Designed structural components, including beams, columns, and the foundation system, ensuring they complied with guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Application:</strong> Applied the NBC 105_2020 provisions to ensure compliance with seismic zoning and earthquake-resistant measures.</li>
        <li><strong>Report Preparation and Presentation:</strong> Compiled a final project report and presented our findings, detailing the analysis, calculations, and design solutions to the faculty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools and Software Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ETABS:</strong> Used for dynamic analysis of the multi-storeyed structure under seismic loads.</li>
        <li><strong>AutoCAD:</strong> For drafting the design elements, ensuring compliance with seismic design specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>MS Excel:</strong> For performing manual calculations and organizing seismic load data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding and Implementing NBC 105_2020:</strong> Adhering to the code's specific provisions was a complex task, requiring a strong understanding of seismic design principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Seismic Load Calculation:</strong> Determining appropriate seismic loads for different building components required careful consideration of local seismic zone data.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Coordination:</strong> Managing a team of classmates with diverse roles required excellent coordination to ensure that each part of the design process was accurate and aligned with the project goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcomes and Results</h2>
    <p>The project successfully designed a building capable of withstanding seismic forces in compliance with the latest NBC 105_2020 guidelines. We developed a comprehensive report and design documentation that was well-received by the professors and demonstrated our understanding of seismic engineering and building codes.</p>
